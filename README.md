# HTTP Status Code

  An HTTP status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled.

  The W3C sets status codes specs. Status codes are embedded in the HTTP header of a page to tell the browser the result of its request.

## The different status codes and what they say
There are five ranges of HTTP status codes. Each range defines where the error was encountered and the number defines what the actual error was.

Here are the 5 ranges and what they mean:


## Table of Contents

- [1xx: Informational](#1xx)
- [2xx: Success!](#2xx)
- [3xx: Redirect. The requested page has moved somewhere else.](#3xx)
- [4xx: Client error. There's something wrong with the way the browser asked for the page.](#4xx)
- [5xx: Server error. Something went wrong with the way the server tried to send the page.](#5xx)

## HTTP Status Codes Important for SEO
   Obviously, all status codes are important "You should know how healthy your site is" but there are certain ones that are particularly important for SEO(Search Engine Optimization) and anyone working on a website.
