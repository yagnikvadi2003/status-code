# HTTP Status Code

  An HTTP status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled.

  Status codes specs are set by the W3C. Status codes are embedded in the HTTP header of a page to tell the browser the result of its request.

## The different status codes and what they say
There are five ranges of HTTP status codes. Each range defines where the error was encountered and the number defines what the actual error was.

Here are the 5 ranges and what they mean:

- 1xx: Informational
- 2xx: Success!
- 3xx: Redirect. The requested page has moved somewhere else.
- 4xx: Client error. There 's something wrong with the way the browser asked for the page.
- 5xx: Server error. Something went wrong with the way the server tried to send the page.
